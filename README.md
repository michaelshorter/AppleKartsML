# AppleKartsML
A revised version of AppleKarts

This code runs on an Arduino Nano BLE Sense. The microphone picks up and classifies the four notes played on a [toy trumpet](https://www.nda-toys.com/product/5218/bontempi-silver-trumpet-42cm-wholesale). 

When each note is played an LED is lit up on pins 4,5,6 and 7.
